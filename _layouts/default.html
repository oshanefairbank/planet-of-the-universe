<!-- Here we put everything which is common to every page here -->
<!-- in the index.html, we put only things that are unique to the index there -->
<!-- Then we need to put in a "place holder" so that jekyll knows where to 
put the unique information -->
<!-- the placeholder is in double curly braces and is called content
i.e. {{content}} -->
<!-- then in the index.html we need to tell jekyll what layout jekell is going to use -->
<!-- we put that between two triple "-"  in the index.html -->
